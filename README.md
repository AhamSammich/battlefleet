ABOUT THIS PROJECT
The Goal
My goal is to use this project to learn the fundamentals of the TypeScript language and Vue framework.
I have made a similar single-player project using Python and Pygame, which can be found here (link).
Additionally, I hope to create a multiplayer online experience while learning how to use web sockets and auth APIs.
